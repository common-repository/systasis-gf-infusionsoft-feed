== Changelog ==

= 3.0.0 =
Implement Keap Service Account Key (SAK) support.
  You must replace your Legacy API key with a SAK before 31-Oct-2024.
  Site admins will be reminded to generate a SAK on Gravity Forms admin screens until that replacement occurs.
  See <a href="https://help.keap.com/help/api-key" target="_blank">these instructions</a> for help with this process.
  Copy the generated value to the Feed configuration.
  IMPORTANT: Do not re-use the key. Generate a key for each Keap connection, even if it's also a WordPress plugin.

  This is an irreversible upgrade after 31-Oct-2024. 
  This Feed Add-On will cease to function using a Legacy API key after that date per <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1maBNDXt3RcOUbq6OkclInsL6wH9uct_YOZ3GpzqZ0_g/edit" target="_blank">Keap email</a>.
  
  Rename Feed Add-On to Keap Connect.

  Complete transition to private Keap SDK. Obsolete wp_options named INFUSIONSOFT_API_KEY & INFUSIONSOFT_APP_NAME. If no other plugins use the Novak SDK, these entries can be removed.

== Additional Info ==

=== Clear Cache ===
Due to Keap API usage limits, Gravity Forms stores Keap custom fields data for twelve hours.
If you make a change to your custom fields, you might not see it reflected immediately due to this data caching.

1. Navigate to Gravity Forms Settings > Systasis Gravity Forms Feed Add-On
1. Click the "Clear Custom Fields Cache" button

=== Affiliate Field Type ===
The Feed Add-On supports affiliate tracking using a custom field type.
The purpose of this field is to extract an Affiliate Code or ID from the URL, and send it to Keap via its link tracking service.
You will use this field as follows:

1. Add an instance of it to a Gravity Form
2. Configuring the resulting field to indicate the name of the URL query variable

==== Step One: Add an Affiliate field ====
Find the Affiliate ID field in the "Advanced Fields" section

The Affiliate Id field is a *hidden* field on your form
Add the field to a form like any other field, usually at the top of the form.

==== Step Two: Configure an Affiliate field ====
The only configuration required for an Affiliate` field is to name the URL query parameter.

The presence of this field triggers the Feed Add-On to create a link tracking record for the Affiliate in the newly created or updated Contact.

1. Open the field's configuration panel, then click the "General" tab
2. Change the Field Label value to "Affiliate Code" from "Untitled"
1. Click the "Advanced" tab
2. Enter the name of the URL query parameter in the "Parameter Name" setting
   + Name the field "affiliate" when the form will be loaded by an Infusionsoft Referral Partner link, found on the Referral Partner Center.
   + The name choice is yours to make when the form will be loaded via links you create in emails or other web pages.

=== Data Type Mapping ===
Describes how Gravity Forms data types map to Keap data types.

These are suggested GF types. The GF Single Line Text data type will map to any Keap data type.
For example, Keap will not store a Single Line Text with the value "32-Jan-2018" as a Date data type.

Keap data types that **do not** define value choices will reject a bad value when that value is out of range.
Keap data types that define value choices will accept any value even when that value is not in the choice list.
